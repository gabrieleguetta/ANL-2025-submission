Supply Chain Scenario
Context: A manufacturer (center agent) negotiates with suppliers (edge agents) for raw materials.
Center Agent Goal: Secure enough materials to meet production quota while minimizing costs and ensuring quality.
Edge Agents: Steel supplier, Electronics supplier, Packaging supplier, Logistics provider
Issues:

Quantity (tons/units needed)
Quality grade (standard, premium, ultra-premium)
Delivery schedule (immediate, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
Price per unit

Utility Structure:

Center utility maximized when total quantity meets production needs with balanced quality/cost
Edge agents prefer larger quantities and higher prices
Dependencies: late delivery from one supplier affects entire production
