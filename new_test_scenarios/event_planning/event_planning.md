Event Planning Scenario
Context: A wedding planner (center agent) negotiates with different vendors (edge agents) for a wedding.
Center Agent Goal: Plan a complete wedding within budget while maximizing overall satisfaction.
Edge Agents: Caterer, Photographer, Venue, Band/DJ, Florist
Issues:

Budget allocation (how much to spend with each vendor)
Service level (basic, premium, luxury)
Date flexibility (preferred dates, backup dates)

Utility Structure:

Center utility peaks when total spending is close to budget and service combination creates a cohesive experience
Edge agents prefer higher payments and premium service levels
Some combinations work better together (luxury venue + premium catering)
